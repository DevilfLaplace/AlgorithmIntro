# Introduction To Algrorithms
In this repository I followed the algorithm design course of [BTKAkademi](https://www.btkakademi.gov.tr/portal/course/algoritma-tasar-m--5092#!/about). In this course we make so much small functions about 'File' operations, 'Matrix' functions, 2 functions with 'String' and 'Mathematichs' with 4 functions.

* String.cs
    * Prime Divisors (8-50) (`Finds the divisors of the number`)
    * Number Of Vowels (52-67) (`Finds the vowels count in input`)
* Mathematics.cs
    * Greatest Common Divisor (8-33) (`Finds the greatest common divisor of two given number`)
    * Least Common Factor (35-66) (`Finds the least common factor of two given numbers`)
    * Binary Converter (68-98) (`Turns the binary to decimal based system`)
    * Prime Divisors (100-122) (`Finds the divisors of the number`)
* File.cs
    * File Info (9-30) (`Prints the file informations on to console`)
    * Create( ,  ) (35-58) (`Creates a new file with given type in the project with given name`)
    * Create( , ,  ) (60-78) (`Creates a new file with given in the given path with given name`)
    * Write (83-127) (`Creates a new .txt file and fill it with given text or string matrix`)
    * Add (132-182) (`Adds the given text or string matrix to end of the given file in one line`)
    * Read (187-211) (`Readsthe readable files`)
    * Copy To (216-233) (`Copies the file to the given destination`)
    * Delete (238-254) (`Deletes the file`)
* Matrix.cs
    * Print (7-29) (`Prints the one ore two dimensional matrices`)
    * Fill (31-54) (`Fills the one or two dimensional matrices with random numbers in the range of given max and min value`)
    * Is Square Matrix (59-64) (`Checks the matrix if its line and column is equal`)
    * Is Same (66-89) (`Checks the matrices if they same`)
    * Is Symmetrical (91-104) (`Checks if the matrix is symmetrical`)
    * Is Diagonal (106-121) (`Checks if the diagonals is filled and the other elements are zero`)
    * Is Top Triangle (123-139) (`Checks if the matrix is top triangle`)
    * Is Bottom Triangle (141-157) (`Checks if the matrix is top triangle`)
    * Detarminant (162-188) (`Finds the detarminant of 2x2 or 3x3 matrix`)
    * Sum Of Elements (190-214) (`Collects elements in one or two dimensional matrices`)
    * Trace Of Matrix (217-236) (`Finds trace of a square matrix`)
    * Diagonal Elements (238-257) (`Finds the numbers on the diagonal matrix of the given square matrix`)
    * Create( , , ,  ) (262-279) (`Creates a new two dimensional matrix`)
    * Create( , ,  ) (281-296) (`Creates a new two dimensional matrix`)
    * Symmetrical Matrix (298-324) (`Creates a symmetrical matrix with random numbers in range of given max and min value`)
    * Clone Numbers Matrix( ,  ) (`Creates a matrix that all the numbers inside is zero`)
    * Clone Number Matrix( , ,  ) (`Creates a that all the numbers inside is given number`)
    * Diagonal Matrix( ,  ) (`Creates a square matrix and fill the diagonal with the given number`)
    * Diagonal Matrix( , ,  ) (`Creates a square matrix and fill the diagonals with random numbers in the range of given max and min value`)
    * Top Triangle (382-397) (`Fills the diagonal and top of the square matrix, fills the remain elements by zero`)
